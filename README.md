Hello, this is my solution to the task.

How to start the project:
1. Go to project directory
2. Start command: npm install
3. Start command: ts-node .\main.ts


If the project starts correctly in the console should be rendered:
 - Reels positions;
 - Screen symbols;
 - Payout lines;

After that in the console should be rendered the BONUS task with:
 - Totals wins - profit;
 - Total bets;
 - Total wins lines;
 - Execution speed.

I was thinking of separating the result printing from the spin method, but I wasn't sure if that would be right according to the condition. I also couldn't think of a more appropriate controller folder name.
